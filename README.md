# Project: Enhancing Lead Conversion Rates for X Education

## Overview
This repository contains all the files and documents related to the project aimed at increasing the lead conversion rates for X Education. The project utilises a logistic regression model to predict and enhance the likelihood of lead conversion by scoring leads based on their probability of converting. The repository includes a main Python notebook with detailed code and visualisations, two PDF documents containing a summary report and responses to specific business questions, and a presentation that outlines the business implications of our findings.

## Contents
1. **Assignment.ipynb** - A Jupyter notebook containing all Python code used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation, complete with comments and visualisations.
2. **Summary Report.pdf** - A document summarising the methodology, findings, and insights from the project, explaining how data-driven strategies can effectively enhance lead conversion rates.
3. **Assignment Subjective Questions.pdf** - A document addressing specific questions posed by the company, providing detailed answers based on the analysis and model outcomes.
4. **Presentation.pdf** - A presentation detailing the projectâ€™s approach, key findings, and strategic recommendations, focusing on the significant factors influencing lead conversions and actionable business strategies.
5. **README.md** - This file, providing an overview and guide to the repository's contents.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Utilizes various visualisations to uncover insights into the factors affecting lead conversion.
- **Model Building**: Details the development and tuning of a logistic regression model.
- **Lead Scoring**: Explains the conversion of model outputs into actionable lead scores.
- **Business Insights**: Discusses the most influential factors leading to lead conversion and offers targeted recommendations for improving conversion rates.
